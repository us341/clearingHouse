<Purpose>
  This is a utility module to provide functions to valid user input for specific
  situations such as account registration. These methods raise a
  ValidationError if the value being checked is invalid. The message of the
  exceptions --- which is accessible with, for example str(e) --- will contain
  publicly-displayable information about why the validation failed. If the
  validation succeeds, nothing is returned.
