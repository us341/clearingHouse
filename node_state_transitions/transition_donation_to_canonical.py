<Program>
  transition_donation_to_canonical.py

<Purpose>
  The purpose of this program is to transition nodes from the
  donation state to the canonical state. The canonical state
  is the state from which we can do anything sensible. It is the
  state that all nodes should return to eventually before going
  to the next state
