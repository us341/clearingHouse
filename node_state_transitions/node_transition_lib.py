<Purpose>
  This is a library file for the node transition scripts. It is a general 
  module so all the transition scripts will be able to import this file 
  and easily create a new transition script.

<Usage>
  Meant to be imported.

<Information>
  The transitional script is meant to seek out all the nodes that 
  are currently advertising and check their states. If necessary, 
  the state of the node is changed. Currently a node can be in three 
  different state: donated state, canonical state, and one percent state. 
  The donated state is when new nodes are discovered. This is usually 
  when a new user installs seattle and donates resources. The transitional
  scripts finds all the nodes that have been donated and processes them. 
  The information about the donated nodes are added to the database and 
  the node state is changed to the canonical state. The canonical state 
  is an important state, as this is the state where the nodes are ready to 
  be used, and be split up. All nodes should be able to come back to the 
  canonical state if anything goes wrong. At this point the canonical state 
  is changed to the onepercent state. This is where the 10% resource is
  taken and split into 10 sections (or into 1% resources). This 1% resource 
  is the vessel. Thus a node manager is responsible for 10 vessels (by 
  default, if only 10% resource is donated). In the future we might have 
  other states such as a twopercent state, in case we want to split the 
  resource differently.
