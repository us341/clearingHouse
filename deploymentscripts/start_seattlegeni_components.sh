# <Purpose>
#   This script will start the various components of SeattleGeni in the correct
#   order (namely, lockserver first, then backend, then the rest). It will also
#   gracefully restart apache. This script should be used rather than
#   stopping/starting components individually to ensure that all components use
#   a fresh lockserver after they have been restarted.
# <Usage>
#    As root, run:
#      ./start_seattlegeni_components.sh
#    Once started, the processes will not exit until its children have. To kill
#    all components of seattlegeni (except apache), send a SIGINT or SIGTERM to
#    this process.
